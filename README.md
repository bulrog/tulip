## ideas

- plot of the game is about information: predict everything by knowing everything and control the world
- hacking game with learning programming
- manage 2 characters and 1 is good and 1 is bad and 1 tries to block the other
- not too many graphism but do them myselves
- level editors on the phone
- from a level can go to different levels
- a level can inherit another level and can add or remove elemtent (or group of elements so need grouping as well).
- between levels can add stories so can do a story mode
- people can share their levels
- physic games:

-- magnetic attraction
-- invert of gravity

- control other characters/ennemy with control device
- real world movie type and then game enters the real world when break something...
- speak in chti and subtiltes are in good french
- story AI in real world but need to go back in virtual world but does not know
- starts with the need to get coffee and can only get it at the end and not a must in the game but give a good bonus
- need to put 80's references:

-- skynet
-- goonies


## software

- Engine to use:

-- To review GameSalad -> expensive if wants to deploy to phone so to review godot/unity
-- godot: could deploy on android after generating debug and release keys and downloading the godot template (850MB) so seems to work
-- godot also allows to play video in ogv and I was able to do so with video editor to convert a mp4 and then run it on my PC so looks good as well
-- still to review for point and click engine as some on top of godot.
